##Image classification of food with Pinterest

A project that classifies food images via SVM (Support Vector Machine) with 'bag-of-visual-words' clustered, OpenCV SIFT and RGB extracted features. Thousands of food images were scraped from Pinterest for model training. In this repo you will find:

* `pinterest_scraper.ipynb`: Selenium-based, image scraping python script tailored to Pinterest.com <br />
* `image_feature_extraction.ipynb`: Extraction and clustering python script of computer vision features <br />
